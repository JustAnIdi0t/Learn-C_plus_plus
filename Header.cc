// This will introduce headers
//
// Headers are imported at the beginning of a script, and can be used to access special keywords
//
// for example
//
#include <iostream>

//A header must start with a # to tell the computer that it is about to use methods from another source
//
//the include is used as a segway to the header
//
//the <> have to be around a header
//
//iostream stands for input output stream
//
//This just means that we can use it to take input from a user using the keyword cin, and output something using the keyword cout
//
//for example
//
int main()
{
	std::cout << "Hello there";
	std::cin >> "hello there";
	return 0;
}

//One takes in an input, and one puts one out
//
//the >> and << are used with cout and cin, always
