# Learn-C_plus_plus

I am on the journey of learning C++. I want to document all of my progress as I learn. This is for multiple reasons, but the main one is just as a reference. I began programming in python 5/2021. It is currently 7/30/2021. I have very little knowledge of computers and programming as a whole. This is my first repository, so expect it to be a little sloppy.
